# Game Testing Concepts

I believe the two skills that are important for game testers are patience and dedication. 

I believe the hardest things about being a game tester is how tedious all of the tasks are. You are not able to 
know what it going to make the game glitch or behave the way it does. By putting a new item or a piece of new 
coding in that item, you could break it. I also thought that the continuous playing of a level was difficult 
because once you add something you test it and everyone will have a specific task to do everyday even after the 
game is complete. So, you have to not only be dedicated for the game, but also have dedication with patience 
for your team. 

Even though there are some difficult tasks about game testing, I still like the whole concept of usability and
playtesting. The reason being is there are so many different ways people play games and sometimes you have to 
experience another person's way of playing the game so that you can make the game better. It's exactly like
playing a game and getting stuck in a hard section. If you watch somebody else play it, it then 
becomes apparent what needs to be done to get past the problem you were having. If you are designing a level,
it may seem easy to you because you've been playing it the same way over and over again to get to the end, but 
if you don't see someone else play it you won't see the flaws of the actual game.
