- Candy Crush Saga
# Summary
Candy Crush Saga is a free-to-play match three casual puzzle game. The way the game is played is to try and swap two candies of the same 
color with another to create a match of three with a certain set number of moves. If the player is not able to complete the task with the 
set number of moves the player's lives will diminish. When there are no lives left, the player will have to wait in real time until 
another life is given back to start playing again. There are ways to avoid running out of lives. There are special candies that you can 
create. If you can match 3 and 3, then you can create a packaged candy which explodes a section. Matching a set of 4 creates a striped 
candy which can clear a row or column. Finally, matching a set of 5 creates a sprinkled candy which will get rid of a certain color for 
the entire board. 
By combining these created candies, the player can clear out a ton of candies making it possible to progress to the
next round. Another way you can avoid running out of lives is by winning at the end of every round. You are given rewards for completing a 
level and when you level up you are also given rewards. These rewards can be found in your backpack inventory and used during gameplay. 
The way the game looks is similar to Candy Land. There is a road that leads you further up to the next point on the map and along the way 
you meet interesting characters. 
# Final Thoughts
This game can be very addictive because it can be challenging. Sometimes I felt that when it was giving me hints by making the candies
that can match glow, it was also throwing me off. In a way, it makes you think more though about the matches you want to make. The way the 
game is designed reminds me of a never-ending version of the board game Candy Land but that is also another addicting feature I like about 
the game. The fact that it seems never-ending, usually a competitive player will want to play to the end. Usually for most games,
there has to be an end. The music is soothing, so the player can play casually without feeling rushed and stressed and the colors are 
vibrant which is another feature I tend to love about games. When you can achieve multiple completions of candies being matched it 
also entices you to keep playing by saying phrases like "Juicy" which I thought was funny. There is also the option to buy items in the 
game which can help you progress further if you want to get to a higher level quicker. Overall, I thought the game was fun and 
interesting to play. You can play when it is convenient for you and it was easy to download.
