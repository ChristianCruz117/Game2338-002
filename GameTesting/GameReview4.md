- Candy Crush Saga
# Summary
Candy Crush Saga is a free-to-play match three casual puzzle game. The way the game is played is to try and swap two candies of the same 
color with another to create a match of three with a certain set number of moves. If the player is not able to complete the task with the 
set number of moves the players lives will diminish. When there are no lives left, the player will have to wait in real time until another 
life is given back to start playing again. There are ways to avoid running out of lives. There are special candies that you can create. If 
you are able to match 3 and 3, then you can create a packaged candy which explodes a section. Matching a set of 4 creates a striped candy 
which can clear a row or column. Finally, matching a set of 5 creates a sprinkled candy which will get rid of a certain color for the 
entire board. 
By combining these created candies the player is able to clear out a ton of candies making it possible to progress to the
next round. Another way you can avoid running out of lives is by winning at the end of every round. You are given rewards for completing a 
level and when you level up you are also given rewards. These rewards can be found in your backpack inventory and used during gameplay. 
The way the game looks is similar to Candy Land. There is a road that leads you further up to the next point on the map and along the way 
you meet interesting characters. 
# Final Thoughts
This game can be very addictive because it can be challenging. Sometimes I felt that when it was giving me hints by making the candies
that can match glow, it was also throwing me off. In a way it makes you think more though about the matches you want to make. The way the 
game is designed reminds me of a never ending version of the board game Candy Land but that is also another addicting feature. The fact 
that it seems never ending, usually a competitive player will want to play to the end because usually for every game, there has to be an 
end. The music is soothing so the player can play casually and the colors are vibrant which is another feature I tend to love about games. 
When you are able to achieve multiple completions of candies being matched it also entices you to keep playing by saying phrases like 
"Juicy" which I thought was funny.
