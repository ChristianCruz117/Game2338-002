As an assassin, he will fight without being seen, hunt with the help of his hawk in the shadows, challenge the gods and change the course 
of history.
# Final Thoughts
Ubisoft has yet again introduced me to another Assassin's Creed game that is captivating and amazing to play. The visuals are stunning and 
that is a lot to say about vasts lands of desert. This time you were able to use not only eagle vision but hawk vision. The introduction 
to the hawk, Senu, was perfect because roaming around a map for hours repeatedly can be repetitive and sometimes tiresome. The game 
controls are definitely different from the last couple of games which I was somewhat thrown off by. The signature hidden blades are not 
introduced right away either. However, you become acustomed to that with the enemies they immediately throw at you and the missions you 
are able to play.
