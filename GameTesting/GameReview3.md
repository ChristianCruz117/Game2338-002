on the brink of collapse, he must become and join the brotherhood of assassins to hunt down the corrupt and bring justice to his homeland. 
As an assassin, he will fight without being seen, hunt with the help of his hawk in the shadows, challenge the gods, and change the course 
of history.
# Final Thoughts
Ubisoft has yet again introduced me to another Assassin's Creed game that is captivating and amazing to play. The visuals are stunning and 
that is a lot to say about vast lands of desert. This time you were able to use not only eagle vision but hawk vision. The introduction 
to the hawk, Senu, was perfect because roaming around a map for hours repeatedly can be repetitive and sometimes tiresome. Now, you can 
hunt for resources like weapons and clothing a different way instead of constantly pushing eagle vision. The game controls are definitely 
different from the last couple of games which I was somewhat thrown off by. The signature hidden blades are not introduced right away 
either. However, you become accustomed to that with the enemies they immediately throw at you and the missions you can play. 
Gameplay is also different in some aspects. Collecting loot is more immediate which is different from waiting around while holding a 
button. The way the character Bayek climbs was also interesting because it was more fluid. For example, when you let the character climb 
a mountain I did not find the character getting stuck to be pushed in a different direction to climb a certain way. Being stealthy is
still somewhat the same like hiding in tall grass and climbing to evade enemies. One move I found interesting was that, Bayek can now 
jump off a ledge and shoot someone with his arrow in a slow cinematic way. Due to how many Assassin's Creed games there are, I believe the 
whole way the game is designed is meant to be different so the player can be introduced to something entirely new, and  because of that
I cannot wait to play Odyssey to see what more Assassin's Creed has to offer.
