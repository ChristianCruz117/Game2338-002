Batman Arkham VR is a virtual reality game developed by Rocksteady Studios. The game allows you to play
from the perspective of DC's comic book superhero Batman. After playing this game on Playstation 4 Pro 
with the Playstation VR headset and Playstation move motion controllers, there are several functions
I think a tester should look at.

The first function that should be tested is the calibration settings for the game. There is one for sitting
and standing. Both need to be tested further. While standing, the function seems to work accurately 
enough, but while sitting the calibration needs further improvement. There was difficulty in grabbing 
the gadgets that are accessed at the waist to the point where the player might need to reach in 
uncomfortable positions. Other times, the utility belt was right in front of your torso. This will also 
need to be tested in different environment settings: close or far distances and dark or light settings. 


Other functions that should be tested are the hand movements of the character like grabbing items and putting 
items back on the utility belt. There were times when the characters hands would spin in circles when standing 
completely still. When grabbing an object, the object will shake even though hand is steady and fall on 
its own. When grabbing items in the utility belt, the forensic analyzer and grapnel gun sometimes will stop working 
when standing completely still. Putting the items back on your utility belt should also be tested. Items sometimes will 
not go back to the designated highlighted area. This occurs with both sitting and standing. 


Lastly, I would recommend to test the visuals of the game itself. Adjustments to the headset were made in multiple
different ways and visuals inside the headset still seemed blurry. 


These are just some of the functions that should be tested.
