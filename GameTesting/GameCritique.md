Batman Arkham Vr is a virtual reality game developed by Rocksteady Studios. The game allows you to play
from the perspective of DC's comic book superhero Batman. After playing this game on Playstation 4 Pro 
with the Playstation VR headset and Playstation move motion controllers, there are a several functions
I think a tester should look at.
