Batman Arkham Vr is a virtual reality game developed by Rocksteady Studios. The game allows you to play
from the perspective of DC's comic book superhero Batman. After playing this game on Playstation 4 Pro 
with the Playstation VR headset and Playstation move motion controllers, there are a few functions
I think a tester should look at.

The first function that should be tested is the calibration settings for the game. There is one for sitting
and standing. Both need to be tested further. While standing, the function seems to work accurately 
enough, but while sitting the calibration needs further improvement. There was difficulty in grabbing 
the gadgets that are accessed at the waist to the point where the player might need to reach in 
uncomfortable positions. Other times, the utility belt was right in front of your torso. This will also 
need to be tested in different environment settings: close or far distances and dark or light settings. 
Other functions to be tested is the hand movements of the character, putting items back on utility belt, and
grabbing items. When grabbing an object, the object will shake and fall on its own. When grabbing
items in utility belt, the forensic analyzer and grapnel gun sometimes will stop working 
when standing completely still. Putting the items back on your belt should also be tested
