Research and review the various ways you could use Heroku to implement a CI solution. 
Describe where the various technologies Heroku has to offer fit into each of the testing environments. 
Document a possible approach on how to use it for your next "online game project".

Heroku can automatically run your apps,test, deploy and deliver code. When integrated with Heroku 
Pipeline, Heroku CI lets you easily manage continuous integrations and continuous delivery
automation across multiple apps and environments. 

During the development environment, developers will write code and unit test. Heroku helps with this
process by automatically testing code. This process helps when new code is created and helps 
teams save hours. 

After code has been successfully tested and processed to the QA environment, smoke and regression 
testing can begin with testing new features and fixes. 

Staging and piloting can begin after code has been validated through QA. 

Finally for the production environment, Heroku has a release phase that lets you run certain tasks
before the final release. 

In conclusion, Heroku would be perfect for developing an online game project because it helps 
ship code quickly and confidently. Its third party add-ons enhance functionality for devolpment.
