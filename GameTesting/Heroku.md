Heroku can automatically run your apps, test, deploy, and deliver code. When integrated with Heroku 
Pipeline, Heroku CI lets you easily manage continuous integration and continuous delivery
automation across multiple apps and environments. 

During the development environment, developers will write code and unit test. Heroku helps with this
process by automatically testing code. This process helps when new code is created and helps 
teams save hours by providing a log of errors found over time before transferring to QA.

After code has been successfully tested and processed to the QA environment, smoke and regression 
testing can begin with testing new features and fixes. 

Finally for the staging and production environment, they are handled once you set up a staging
and production application. You can help prevent bugs in your code from being deployed to the production 
environment by maintaining these separate environments as different Heroku apps under a main
branch. Heroku Chatops provides a way for you or your team to ensure you are launching code that has passed by
communicating.Heroku also has a release phase that lets you run certaintask before the final release and 
then provides a way to publish your work. 

In conclusion, Heroku would be perfect for developing an online game project because it helps 
ship code quickly and confidently with easy organization. Its third party add-ons enhance 
functionality for devolpment. Heroku also has shareable content so that the builds and test 
results appear in a permanent URL that can be easily shared for team collaboration. Another
feature is that you can choose to collaborate with other developers. This would be beneficial 
for a team developing an online game to know where everything is and your project
would be available in case changes need to be performed.
